# Smart Meteo
Smart (Bluetooth Smart) meteo station - DIY hardware & code

Basic idea is to create universal meteo station that broadcasts readings as beacon that can be read by mobile app (probably demo app will be written in Xamarin) and other devices like [zegar-beta](https://github.com/danielskowronski/zegar-beta) (or rather zegar-alpha - when it'll be completed...)

## electronics
nRF51822 with I2C sensors (thermo, humidity, pressure)

## code
